This is a simple website that hosts all the projects we worked on during this comm Lab class. I tried including all the little elements we learned so far to make a fun yet dynamic site. My goal was to make the navigation as interesting as I can while maintaining the simplest form of interactions. 

My only difficulty with this project was that some code would work only on certain websites i.e. safari vs. chrome. And when it work on said site it made other code snippets stop working. So, although I aimed a little high, I was restricted a lot by the web application I was using.
